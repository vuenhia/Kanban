🧠 What I Learned
State Management
- Managing nested state objects for multiple columns
- Updating state immutably during drag‑and‑drop
- Using lazy initialization in useState to prevent overwriting saved data
- Syncing state with localStorage using useEffect

  
Drag & Drop Logic
- Passing task + column metadata through components
- Handling drag start, drag end, and drop events
- Preventing unwanted re-renders
- Ensuring tasks move cleanly between columns

  
Layout & Responsive Design
- Solving flexbox wrapping issues
- Using min-width: 0 and flex: 1 for proper text wrapping
- Structuring task cards with text + actions
- Creating stable, predictable column layouts

  
Debugging
- Fixing state overwrite issues on initial render
- Solving text overflow in flex containers
- Handling Enter key behavior in textareas and inputs
- Ensuring edit mode and drag mode don’t conflict


🔮 Future Improvements
- Reordering tasks within the same column
- Column color themes
- Task priority levels
- Animations on drag hover
- Add subtasks or descriptions
- Add a backend for multi-user boards

  

🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted a simple, clean, and highly responsive Kanban board that feels good to use — something lightweight but polished, with smooth drag‑and‑drop and intuitive editing.
Instead of using an existing tool, I built my own to deepen my understanding of React state, UI patterns, and real‑world component architecture.
